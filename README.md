# WakeMeUP

C# program that checks for user inactivity by monitoring mouse activity and moving the mouse cursor slightly if there has been no mouse activity for a 90 seconds. 
This program is a simple way to prevent the computer from going to sleep or locking due to inactivity.

Works only on windows 10, 11 and Windows Servers 2016-2019 with .Net Framework 4.8 or newer installed.
